## General Information
- Boombikes company is a bike rental company that wants to maxmize the profits after taking a serious dip due lockdowns in Covid.
- The company has provided past years data to be analized and summarized for the purpose of pridiction of future demand factors.
- Using Linear regression we will predict the features that greatly impact the demand of the rental bikes.
- The dataset is data recorded by the company for the year 2018 and 2019 to examine the demand in a post covid world.


## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1: The impact of the registered users is very much while the pridiction of the demand. Hence if company wants to boost the profits they should focus on the users that are registered
